# Leetcode

As I am preparing for a technical interview, I will solve at least one question per day.<br>
And I will push the code here.<br>
My **[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/prajun7/)** profile.<br>

I am starting this year with a promise of being consistent throughout the year. Consistency is the key to success.
